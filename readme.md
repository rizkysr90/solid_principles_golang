# Open-Closes Principle


The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its source code.

In Go (Golang), there is no strict concept of classes and inheritance as in traditional object-oriented languages. However, you can still follow the principles of SOLID, including the Open/Closed Principle.
